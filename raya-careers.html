                                            This is my first time writing to newspaper.it is because i read your report which young people were happy to be unemployed. I am a school leaver, so i have different opinion with your report. In my opinion, school leavers need much more detailed careers guidance. Moreover, i think schools should offer courses that Will prepare students for wherever they are going in life- and that means offering both college and career preparation. Furthermore, the majority of the companies in your town are related to technology,whereas some school leavers around here are not computer -literate. Companies should form a partnership with schools to develop training schemes which would enable us to learn the skills needed for the job. I would also like to add that not all young people are happy with their life without a job. You wrote that rich parents help them to be happy. I think it is irritating . Many of US have parents who are out of work and we definitely do not want to be like them. When you are at school, getting a job is like a dream. Young people need support and help, not critical as you have given . Questions 1. What is the purpose of the letter 2. What does the write disagree with 3. What is the writer's opinion about school leavers 4.what does the writer feel about the article of newspaper5. write the expression of giving opinion foundin the textYang Bener2 tulus jawab semoga sehat slalu​</a>

A conceptual framework establishes the concepts that underlie financial reporting. A conceptual framework is a coherent system of concepts that flow from an objective. The objective identifies the purpose of financial reporting. The other concepts provide guidance on (1) identifying the boundaries of financial reporting; (2) selecting the trans- actions, other events, and circumstances to be represented; (3) how they should be rec- ognized and measured; and (4) how they should be summarized and reported.1
Need for a Conceptual Framework
Why do we need a conceptual framework? First, to be useful, rule-making should build on and relate to an established body of concepts. A soundly developed conceptual framework thus enables the IASB to issue more useful and consistent pronouncements over time, and a coherent set of standards should result. Indeed, without the guidance provided by a soundly developed framework, standard-setting ends up being based on individual concepts developed by each member of the standard-setting body. The following observation by a former standard-setter highlights the problem.
“As our professional careers unfold, each of us develops a technical conceptual framework. Some individual frameworks are sharply defined and firmly held; others are vague and weakly held; still others are vague and firmly held. </a>

                                            What does the text talk about? 
Many children do not go to school either because their parents want them at home as careers for
siblings, or simply because their parents cannot be bothered to send them. Thousands more are not
registered at any school at all, because of their families' unstable lives.
Underlying this dreadful situation there are two central truths. First of all, the problem of children
not going to school often has more to do with their parents than with the children themselves.
Secondly, once children go to school, we need to make sure that the experience is a positive one
so that they want to keep on going.
In Britain, the Ministry of Education has introduced a complex package of sticks and carrots to
persuade schools to bring truants' and excluded children back into the classroom. It is paying grants
so that a thousand schools can set up special units to help these children. Schools receive the grant
if they bring a target number of children back to school; if they do not meet the target, the grant is
withdrawn. Parents are the subject of this campaign, too: the Home Office has introduced fines for
parents who fail to send their children to school, and has given the police power to pick up truants
on the streets.
A. Children for whom school has no point
B. Families unstable lives
C. Parents for whom school has no point

Most people don't realize how varied the world of accounting is and in fact it is oftenseen as boring. The truth is that accounting is the backbone of any organization and offers a widenumber of attractive careers within it.Below you will hear about just some of the more common careers in the field ofaccountancy, there are of course many more, but we don't have time to talk about all of themWhen we consider the accounts team within a company, we generally think about clerks, bothsales ledger clerks and purchase ledger clerks recording the financial information from alltransactions the company makes. Other roles include the payroll clerk responsible for processingstaff salaries and the tax which occurs from them. Higher up the hierarchy we have themanagement accountant who finalizes the accounts and prepares the annual financial statements.The people doing these jobs make sure that the directors or owners of the company always knowits true financial positionHowever, accounting is more than just reporting financial data. A good accounts teamactually works to save the company money by minimizing the tax payable and delayingpayments so companies can earn interest from their banks.These job roles are not so clear in smaller accounting practices, where the accounting staff oftenneed to perform various tasks from meeting clients to helping with loan applications. Often themajority of the work in these smaller practices is done by bookkeepers Generally, the owner ofthe practice is the most senior accountant and is usually a chaitered accountant, which means thattheir signature is accepted on the financial statementsThe job opportunities for accountants don't stop there auditors are the police of theaccounting world and when they are called into a company it is their job to ensure that theaccounts were done in the correct way and that everything was accounted for.

It is hard to imagine how this could get any worse than it is now. Former Czechoslovakia president, Václav Havel, who has a good image amang his people, showed that politics is the will to make people happy. However, politicians nowadays only full of energy when they talk about power, particularly when the issue brings benefits to them. One scandal occurs and another follows, either by the same or different actors. Recently, for example, several newspapers reveal the evidence that many candidates for the provincial legislative bodies have falsified their academic degrees.

                                            What to do After High School Graduation
Going to college or getting a job right after graduating high school is the common choices of teens will likely face. Some likely choose to continue studying at college or university but the others try to find job. Here are the reasons.
Why is it so important for student to continue on to post-secondary education; university or college? The reason is that post-secondary education will allow them to get the skills and tools that they will need to help them prepare for a good career. It has been said that the more education they have the more careers will be open for them to choose from. Employers today will tend to be more open to a person with the more education.
However some of them choose to get job right after high school. They believe that education is critical but college is not. In fact, there are numerous careers, such as in healthcare, technology, operations, transportation, and the building trades, that do not require a four-year degree from college or university. Furthermore, as they advance in these careers, there is also nothing stopping them from pursing a college degree at a later age.So, what are you doing after graduating high school? Think carefully! The wrong decision may influence your future. But who knows the future? Believe to God and do the best!
Questions: 1. What is the text talking about? 2. What is the choices that can be chosen after graduating? Mention! 3. What makes important in continuing study in the college? 4. What is the statement said by the cons side? 5. What does the employer today look like?​

Furthermore, as they advance in these careers, there is also nothing stopping them from pursing a college degree at a later age.So, what are you doing after graduating high school? Think carefully! The wrong decision may influence your future. But who knows the future? Believe to God and do the best!
Questions: 1. What is the text talking about? 2. What is the choices that can be chosen after graduating? Mention! 3. What makes important in continuing study in the college? 4. What is the statement said by the cons side? 5. What does the employer today look like?​

                            6. This is my first time writing to newspaper.it is because i read your report which young people were happy to be unemployed. I am a school leaver, so i have different opinion with your report. In my opinion, school leavers need much more detailed careers guidance. Moreover, i think schools should offer courses that Will prepare students for wherever they are going in life- and that means offering both college and career preparation. Furthermore, the majority of the companies in your town are related to technology,whereas some school leavers around here are not computer -literate. Companies should form a partnership with schools to develop training schemes which would enable us to learn the skills needed for the job. I would also like to add that not all young people are happy with their life without a job. You wrote that rich parents help them to be happy. I think it is irritating . Many of US have parents who are out of work and we definitely do not want to be like them. When you are at school, getting a job is like a dream. Young people need support and help, not critical as you have given . Questions 1. What is the purpose of the letter 2. What does the write disagree with 3.

Selain itu, seiring mereka maju dalam karir ini, tidak ada juga yang menghentikan mereka untuk mengejar gelar sarjana di usia yang lebih tua. Jadi, apa yang Anda lakukan setelah lulus SMA?

A conceptual framework establishes the concepts that underlie financial reporting. A conceptual framework is a coherent system of concepts that flow from an objective. The objective identifies the purpose of financial reporting. The other concepts provide guidance on (1) identifying the boundaries of financial reporting; (2) selecting the trans- actions, other events, and circumstances to be represented; (3) how they should be rec- ognized and measured; and (4) how they should be summarized and reported.1
Need for a Conceptual Framework
Why do we need a conceptual framework? First, to be useful, rule-making should build on and relate to an established body of concepts. A soundly developed conceptual framework thus enables the IASB to issue more useful and consistent pronouncements over time, and a coherent set of standards should result. Indeed, without the guidance provided by a soundly developed framework, standard-setting ends up being based on individual concepts developed by each member of the standard-setting body. The following observation by a former standard-setter highlights the problem.
“As our professional careers unfold, each of us develops a technical conceptual framework. Some individual frameworks are sharply defined and firmly held; others are vague and weakly held; still others are vague and firmly held. </h2><br />
                        Sebuah kerangka konseptual menetapkan konsep yang mendasari pelaporan keuangan. Sebuah kerangka konseptual adalah sistem yang koheren dari konsep yang mengalir dari tujuan. Tujuannya mengidentifikasi tujuan pelaporan keuangan. Konsep lainnya memberikan panduan tentang (1) mengidentifikasi batas-batas pelaporan keuangan; (2) memilih tindakan antara, acara lainnya, dan keadaan untuk diwakili; (3) bagaimana mereka harus mendasari dikenali dan diukur; dan (4) bagaimana mereka harus meringkas dan melaporkan.1
Butuh Kerangka Konseptual
Mengapa kita perlu kerangka konseptual? Pertama, untuk menjadi berguna, pembuatan aturan harus membangun dan berhubungan dengan suatu badan yang dibentuk dari konsep. Sebuah kerangka konseptual nyenyak dikembangkan sehingga memungkinkan IASB menerbitkan pernyataan yang lebih berguna dan konsisten dari waktu ke waktu, dan seperangkat standar harus menghasilkan. Memang, tanpa bimbingan yang diberikan oleh kerangka nyenyak dikembangkan, standar-pengaturan berakhir yang berbasis pada konsep individu yang dikembangkan oleh masing-masing anggota tubuh penetapan standar. berikut pengamatan oleh mantan standar-setter menyoroti masalah.
"Sebagai karir profesional kami terungkap, kita masing-masing mengembangkan kerangka konseptual teknis. Beberapa kerangka kerja individu tajam didefinisikan dan dipegang teguh; orang lain tidak jelas dan diadakan lemah; yang lain tidak jelas dan tegas diadakan.<br />

registered at any school at all, because of their families' unstable lives.
Underlying this dreadful situation there are two central truths. First of all, the problem of children
not going to school often has more to do with their parents than with the children themselves.
Secondly, once children go to school, we need to make sure that the experience is a positive one
so that they want to keep on going.
In Britain, the Ministry of Education has introduced a complex package of sticks and carrots to
persuade schools to bring truants' and excluded children back into the classroom. It is paying grants
so that a thousand schools can set up special units to help these children. Schools receive the grant
if they bring a target number of children back to school; if they do not meet the target, the grant is
withdrawn. Parents are the subject of this campaign, too: the Home Office has introduced fines for
parents who fail to send their children to school, and has given the police power to pick up truants
on the streets.

Most people don't realize how varied the world of accounting is and in fact it is oftenseen as boring. The truth is that accounting is the backbone of any organization and offers a widenumber of attractive careers within it.Below you will hear about just some of the more common careers in the field ofaccountancy, there are of course many more, but we don't have time to talk about all of themWhen we consider the accounts team within a company, we generally think about clerks, bothsales ledger clerks and purchase ledger clerks recording the financial information from alltransactions the company makes. Other roles include the payroll clerk responsible for processingstaff salaries and the tax which occurs from them. Higher up the hierarchy we have themanagement accountant who finalizes the accounts and prepares the annual financial statements.The people doing these jobs make sure that the directors or owners of the company always knowits true financial positionHowever, accounting is more than just reporting financial data. A good accounts teamactually works to save the company money by minimizing the tax payable and delayingpayments so companies can earn interest from their banks.These job roles are not so clear in smaller accounting practices, where the accounting staff oftenneed to perform various tasks from meeting clients to helping with loan applications. Often themajority of the work in these smaller practices is done by bookkeepers Generally, the owner ofthe practice is the most senior accountant and is usually a chaitered accountant, which means thattheir signature is accepted on the financial statementsThe job opportunities for accountants don't stop there auditors are the police of theaccounting world and when they are called into a company it is their job to ensure that theaccounts were done in the correct way and that everything was accounted for.

It is hard to imagine how this could get any worse than it is now. Former Czechoslovakia president, Václav Havel, who has a good image amang his people, showed that politics is the will to make people happy. However, politicians nowadays only full of energy when they talk about power, particularly when the issue brings benefits to them. One scandal occurs and another follows, either by the same or different actors. Recently, for example, several newspapers reveal the evidence that many candidates for the provincial legislative bodies have falsified their academic degrees.

Going to college or getting a job right after graduating high school is the common choices of teens will likely face. Some likely choose to continue studying at college or university but the others try to find job. Here are the reasons.
Why is it so important for student to continue on to post-secondary education; university or college? The reason is that post-secondary education will allow them to get the skills and tools that they will need to help them prepare for a good career.

In fact, there are numerous careers, such as in healthcare, technology, operations, transportation, and the building trades, that do not require a four-year degree from college or university. Furthermore, as they advance in these careers, there is also nothing stopping them from pursing a college degree at a later age.So, what are you doing after graduating high school? Think carefully! The wrong decision may influence your future. But who knows the future? Believe to God and do the best!
Questions: 1. What is the text talking about? 2. What is the choices that can be chosen after graduating? Mention! 3. What makes important in continuing study in the college? 4. What is the statement said by the cons side? 5. What does the employer today look like?​

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Apa yang Harus Dilakukan Setelah Lulus SMA?
</p><p>Pergi ke perguruan tinggi atau mendapatkan pekerjaan setelah lulus sekolah menengah adalah pilihan umum yang kemungkinan akan dihadapi remaja. Beberapa mungkin memilih untuk melanjutkan belajar di perguruan tinggi atau universitas tetapi yang lain mencoba mencari pekerjaan. Inilah alasannya.
</p><p>
</p><p>Mengapa sangat penting bagi siswa untuk melanjutkan ke pendidikan pasca sekolah menengah; universitas atau perguruan tinggi? Alasannya adalah bahwa pendidikan pasca sekolah menengah akan memungkinkan mereka untuk mendapatkan keterampilan dan alat yang mereka perlukan untuk membantu mereka mempersiapkan karir yang baik. Dikatakan bahwa semakin tinggi pendidikan yang mereka miliki, semakin banyak karir yang terbuka bagi mereka untuk dipilih. Pengusaha saat ini akan cenderung lebih terbuka kepada orang yang berpendidikan lebih tinggi.
</p><p>
</p><p>Namun beberapa dari mereka memilih untuk mendapatkan pekerjaan setelah sekolah menengah. Mereka percaya bahwa pendidikan sangat penting tetapi perguruan tinggi tidak. Sebenarnya, ada banyak karir, seperti dalam perawatan kesehatan, teknologi, operasi, transportasi, dan perdagangan bangunan, yang tidak memerlukan gelar empat tahun dari perguruan tinggi atau universitas. Selain itu, seiring dengan kemajuan karir mereka, tidak ada yang menghentikan mereka untuk mengejar gelar sarjana di usia yang lebih tua. Jadi, apa yang Anda lakukan setelah lulus SMA? Pikirkan baik-baik! Keputusan yang salah dapat mempengaruhi masa depan Anda. Tapi siapa yang tahu masa depan? Percaya kepada Tuhan dan lakukan yang terbaik!</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p><strong>hanya bisa jawab bagian itu jangan kecewa ya:&lt;</strong></p><br />
