Wb<br />Good Afternoon,</p><p>Honorable all the juries and the committee of this English speech contest.<br />First of all, let’s thank to Allah SWT who has given us many mercies and blessing so we<br />can join this program without any troubles. Secondly, I would like to introduce myself.<br />My name is ……. I am a student of …..</p><p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, in this occasion I would like to tell you about environment.<br />Environment is everything around us. Environment consists of two main parts which are<br />biotic and a biotic environment. Biotic environment is everything around us which are<br />live, for example plants, animals and human beings. While a biotic environment is<br />everything around us which are not live, for example stone, water, wind, land and etc.<br />We must protect our environment as good as possible because it can influence our live.<br />As we know that Indonesia has many tropical forests and it is a source of nature which<br />can help people live peacefully. So as human being we should preserve the forest.</p><p>There are some efforts which should be done by all people:<br />1. Not cutting down the trees in the forest<br />2. Planting any kinds of trees in the barren area of the forest</p><p>Cutting down the trees in the forest can cause many disasters for human beings. Of<br />course it can cause flood because the rain water can’t be absorbed by the root of plants so<br />the water flows directly to the ground. There are many damage caused by the flood,<br />many people being homeless because of flood, the flood kill many kinds of pet, many<br />factories can’t produce anything, transportation can’t run well because the bridge is<br />broken and so on. How horrified the flood is…!!</p><p>Actually, the disasters above can be minimized if all of human beings can preserve our<br />environment and we must pay more attention to the environment whenever and<br />wherever. We must not throw away rubbish anywhere which can disturb the flowing of<br />the river water. We should plant any kinds of trees in the barren area or in side of the<br />road.</p><p>By doing those simple efforts, it means we have participated in the preservation of our<br />environment.<br />I think that’s all and thank you very much for your attention.<br />Wassalamu ‘alaikum wr. Wb</p><p><br /></p><p>^^</p><br />

And they thought that if they could get all that precious metal at once, they would get mighty rich very soon.

The farmer had given them a lot of advice, but they always turned a deaf ear. They disliked advice. The farmer felt very sad about it.<br /><br />The farmer was thinking hard and then he got a good idea. He called all of his sons and ordered them, “Bring me a few sticks.” Then, the farmer tied the sticks into a bundle.<br /><br />“Each of you, break this bundle of sticks said!” said the farmer to his sons. They did what their father said, but they could not break it. Then, the farmer untied the sticks and gave each of his sons a stick. Each of them broke the stick easily in the glance of an eye.<br /><br />“There you are, my sons!”, said the farmer. “If you remain united, you are strong. But if you quarrel with one another, you will be broken one by one easily. Do you understand what I mean?”<br /><br />At last, the advice worked out. They lived in harmony and united ever after. The farmer felt relieved. “Now I can die peacefully,” he whispered.<br /><br />Hello Friend, I Want To Tell You How To Install Aplication<br /> First: turn on your phone<br /> Second: open play store<br /> Third: search the aplication you want<br /> Fourth: klik install to install the aplication<br /> Finally: open the aplication<br />

                        <p>Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kioto. At such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kioto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kioto, where the great Mikado had his palace.</p><p>So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kioto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other. The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about travelling, and half way between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed. It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another frog before him! They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes. It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their ways.</p><p>'What a pity we are not bigger,' said the Osaka frog; 'for then we could see both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on.'</p><p>'Oh, that is easily managed,' returned the Kioto frog. 'We have only got to stand up on our hind legs, and hold on to each other, and then we can each look at the town he is travelling to.'</p><p>This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his front paws on the shoulders of his friend, who had risen also. There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down. The Kioto frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose towards Kioto; but the foolish things forgot that when they stood up their great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their noses might point to the places to which they wanted to go their eyes beheld the places from which they had come.</p><p>'Dear me!' cried the Osaka frog, 'Kioto is exactly like Osaka. It is certainly not worth such a long journey. I shall go home!'</p><p>'If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kioto I should never have travelled all this way,' exclaimed the frog from Kioto, and as he spoke he took his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell down on the grass. Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for home again, and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and Kioto, which are as different to look at as two towns can be, were as like as two peas.</p>two men were walking along one summer day. soon it became too hot to continue and on seeing a large pain tree nearrby, they threw themselves on the ground to rest in its shade. gazing up into the branches one man said to the other, "what a useless tree! it does not have fruit or nuts that we can eat and we cannot een use its wood for camping." the tree rustled in reply, "don't be so ungrateful. i am being extremely useful to you at this very moment, shielding you from the hot sun. you call me a good-for-nothing!"<br />

                        <p><strong>Once upon a time, a boy was walking through a wood and he thought he could hear a sad cry, as though someone was crying while singing. Following the sound he came to a big, round, mysterious, grey fountain. The sad sobbing seemed to be coming from the fountain pool. The boy swept aside the pool's dirty surface water and saw a group of grey fish swimming in a slow circle through the pond. With each lap they made, their little voices opened and out came the sobbing sound.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Amused by this, the boy tried to catch one of these incredible talking fish. But when he stuck his arm into the water it turned grey right up to the elbow. As this happened, a huge sadness entered into him, and he suddenly understood how sorrowful the fish was feeling. He felt just like the earth on his arm; dirty and contaminated.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>He quickly pulled his arm out of the water, and ran from that place. But the arm stayed grey, and the boy continued feeling sad. He tried so many times to cheer himself up, but nothing worked. That was, until he realised that if he were to make the Earth happy then that happiness would be, in turn, transmitted back to him, through the earth on his arm.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>From then on he set about looking after the countryside. He cared for the plants, he did what he could to keep the water from being polluted, and he encouraged others to do the same. He was so successful that his hand started to recover its normal colour. When the grey had disappeared completely, he started feeling happy again, and he decided to go and visit the fountain. When he was still some way from the fountain he could hear the fish singing happy hymns, and he heard them joyfully splashing in the crystal clear waters of that magic fountain.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It was plain to see that the Earth had returned to its original happiness; and the boy felt even happier at the sight.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Source : https://freestoriesforkids.com/</strong></p><br />

                        Snow White<br /><br />Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named “Putri Salju”. She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead.<br /><br />    One day, she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White. Snow White did not want her uncle and aunt to do this so she decided it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away from home when her aunt and uncle were having breakfast. She ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry.<br /><br />    Then, she saw this little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep. Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. They went inside. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then, Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs. The dwarfs said,”What is your name?” Snow White said, “My name is Snow White”.<br /><br />    The dwarfs said, “If you wish , you may live here with us”. Snow White said, “Oh,could I? Thank you”. Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story and Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.<br />

Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough.<br /><br />They imagined that if the bird must be able to lay golden eggs, its insides must be made of gold. And they thought that if they could get all that precious metal at once, they would get mighty rich very soon.

                        Assalamu’alaikum Wr.Wb.<br />Firstly, I would like to say thank you very much for the MC and juries who have given me<br />opportunity to deliver this English speech.<br />Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />It is a great honor for me to stand here and give a brief speech entitled “Formal Education<br />in Indonesia”<br />Brothers and Sisters;<br />Education system in our country is divided into two major parts, they are formal and<br />non-formal. A formal education is divided into three levels: primary, secondary and<br />tertiary education. While non-formal education is carried out for the learners who get<br />difficulties to meet the requirements in formal education. An example of non-formal<br />education is PLS (Pendidikan Luar Sekolah). Both formal and non-formal education aim<br />at establishing the education process in our country.Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />As I have stated previously, formal education involves three levels: primary, secondary<br />and tertiary education. Before entering primary or elementary school, children in our<br />country usually have attended kindergarten, or known as Taman Kanak-kanak. But this<br />education is not compulsory for Indonesian citizens, as the aim of this is just to prepare<br />them for primary school.Children ages 7–12 attend primary education at Elementary School or Sekolah Dasar.<br />This level of education is compulsory for all Indonesian citizens. Similar to education<br />systems in the U.S. and Australia, students must study for six years to complete this level.<br />Some schools offer an accelerated learning program, where students who perform well<br />can finish elementary school in five years.<br />The next level is secondary education. After graduating from elementary school, students<br />attend Middle School or Junior High School (Sekolah Menengah Pertama) for three years<br />from the age of 13-15. After three years of schooling and graduation, students may move<br />on to Senior High School. In Indonesia, this school is basically divided into two kinds:<br />SMA (Sekolah Menengah Atas) and SMK (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan). SMA is<br />different with SMK in their studies. The students at SMA are prepared to advance to<br />tertiary education or university, while students of SMK as a vocational school are<br />prepared to be ready to work after finishing their school without going to<br />university/college.<br />The last level of education in our country is tertiary education. Students who have<br />graduated from senior high school may attend to university or academy. They can choose<br />any kinds of university or academy based on their interests or scopes of knowledge, for<br />example majoring in English, Mathematics, or teacher training university.Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />Brothers and Sisters;<br />I think that’s all my speech. I hope my brief description on the formal education in our<br />country will be useful for us.<br />Finally, I would like to say sorry if there are mistakes in my speech words.<br />Thank you very much for your attention.<br /><br />Never Surrender To School<br />       Danu is the son of the less fortunate, his mother died at the age of 2 years Danu.

                        storytelling of snow white<br />A
 long time ago, a child was born to a queen and king and she was called 
Snow White.  When the queen died, the king married again.  This new 
queen was wicked and hated Snow white.  The queen gave orders that Snow 
White was to be treated as a servant.
                                    Snow White grew very beautiful and one day a Prince riding by, saw her at work and fell in love with her.
                                    The
 queen was beautiful too, and every day she asked her Magic Mirror, "Who
 is the fairest in the land?" and the mirror always answered, "You are 
the fairest one of all".
                                    But
 one day the mirror answered Snow White was the fairest in the land, and
 in a rage the queen gave orders to one of her Huntsmen to take Snow 
White into the woods and kill her.
                                    The
 Huntsman had a kind heart and couldn't do the deed so told her to run 
away.  She fled into the woods where Seven little dwarfs lived.  Their 
house was small and strange.
                                     
                                
                                
                                    
                                    Snow
 White entered the little house and finding it very untidy, started to 
clean up.  Upstairs she found seven little beds.  She was very tired and
 stretching out on one of the beds, was soon asleep.
                                    When
 the Dwarfs came home they were surprised to find Snow White and after 
some argument, decided to let her stay.  She promised to cook and look 
after them.
                                    The
 Queen discovered where Snow White was living and disguising herself as a
 witch, took a poisoned apple and set out for the Dwarfs cottage.  She 
gave Snow White the poisoned apple to eat and as soon as she bit the 
apple, she sank into unconsciousness.
                                    Thinking
 she was dead, the Dwarfs built a glass coffin and put her in it. For 
days she lay in the forest in her glass coffin.  One day, the Prince was
 riding through the forest looking for Snow White and found her.  He 
leaned over and kissed her.  She opened her eyes and sat up with a 
smile. Everyone was happy.  The Prince took Snow White to his palace 
where they were married and lived happily ever after.<br /><br />

“ THE
BEEF AND THE CAT ”

I do hope you’ll be happy after listening to my story, because
getting the audience or listeners happy is the purpose of this story, isn’t it
?                                                  

Are you ready ?                                                                                                               

Ok listen to me carefully in order to be able to
catch the sound, expression, and others so you can enjoy this story.

Long
time ago in Aksehir, there lived a happy couple. They were Nasrudin Hoja and
his beloved wife. Nasrudin Hoja was a very funny, smart and famous in that
country, so everyone knew him very much. He liked going round his village. One
day, after he was going round, he brought 2 kilos of beef and when he came in
front of the door of his house, he knocked it.

Thok Thok Thok ! Honey I’m comming. Then his wife opened the door for him.

Kreeet,
the sound of the door. Oh dear what is in your hand?

2 kilos of beef, Nasrudin answered.

Please use this to make kabob tonight. We will have a big meal
this night, he said.

Yes, dear I will make nice kabob for you. Said
his Wife.

Thank you honey, said Nasrudin.

As I told
you that Nasrudin liked going round, didn’t he?

He wasn’t
too long at home. Then he asked his wife permission.

Honey, I want to go out again, keep the house, said
Nasrudin

Yes, dear be careful !

Then
Nasrudin went out. But do yuo know after that when Nasrudin was out? His wife
didn’t make kabob for him, but she cooked the meat for making lunch for her
self and her friends instead. Was it a right behavior ? of course no ! It was a
big mistake for her. I think sinned against his husband, Nasrudin.

Then hours
latter, Nasrudin returned and asked whether the kabob was ready.

Honey ! have you finished making kabob? Is it ready now ? I’m
impatient to have it soon,

He
asked his wife.

You know
what about his wife? Of course she was very-very confuse how to answer her
husband’s question, because she has cooked the meat for her lunch and ate it up
with her friend.

Mmm mmm I’m sorry dear, she replied. But the cat ate it all while I was doing chores.

Oh no problem ! said Nasrudin.

Then
Nasrudin grabbed the cat and put it on the scale . And he spoke him self.

This cat weighs 2
kilos,
he remarked. “So if this is the cat, then where is
the beef? An if this the beef, then where is the cat? Oh I’m so confuse about
it.

And finally he said, “where is the beef? Where is
the cat? Where is the beef? Where is the cat? Where is the beef? Where is the
cat?, Until he felt sleep.

Ok, I think it’s all
my story and finally, let me say “Assalamu’alaikum Wr.Wb

                        One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water with a rose in the middle of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell.After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along on the ground, until at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She began to cry, and said, 'Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.'Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, 'Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?''Alas!' said she, 'what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.'The frog said, 'I do not want your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep on your bed, I will bring you your ball again.''What nonsense,' thought the princess, 'this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.'So she said to the frog, 'Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all
Storytelling Pendek The Lonely Landy

One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted
 to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.

<br />

“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too 
sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.

<br />

“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, 
Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to 
you,” said Tito the rooster.

<br />

Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the 
river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”

<br />

Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”

<br />

“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.

<br />

“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. 
Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.

<br />

Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor 
you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and 
helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”

<br />

“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”

<br />

One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his 
friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to 
mess up the party.

<br />

“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” 
said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.

<br />

Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save 
yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku
 pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body 
into a ball.

<br />

Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike 
pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t
 chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.

<br />

“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and 
her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br /><br />semoga membantu :)<br />

This pledge was considered as a crystallization of enthusiasm to affirm the ideals of the establishment of the Indonesian state.<br /><br />What is meant by "Youth Pledge" is the decision of the Second Youth Congress held two days, October 27-28, 1928 in Batavia (Jakarta). This decree affirms that there will be "Indonesian homeland", "Indonesian nation" and "Indonesian language". This decision is also expected to be the principle for every "Indonesian national association" and so that "it is broadcast in all newspapers and read in front of meetings".<br /><br />The term "Youth Pledge" itself does not appear in the decision of the congress, but is given afterwards. The following is the sound of the three congressional decisions as stated in the inscription on the wall of the Youth Oath Museum. Writing using van Ophuysen's spelling.<br /><br /><br />
