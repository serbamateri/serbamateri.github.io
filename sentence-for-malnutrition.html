                                            It is a sad state of affairs when we learn from the print and electronic media that many skinny children in many places in Indonesia are lying helplessly with bloated bellies, in severely
malnourished condition. Ironically, we also have learned from the same print and electronic media reports about massive graft involving huge amounts of money, perpetrated by smartly-dressed, smug officials.
It will not be an odd thing if there are some people who question weather or not these smartly-dressed and smug corruptors who hold office in government and legislative agencies have ever learned of these cases of malnutrition, bloated bellies and poverty, which are rampant inthis country. It seems that these people have lost a fraction of their conscience to take pity on their fellow creatures that have been beset by a such misfortune.
These people should have realized that their disgusting corruption has sent many of their fellow countrymen to the abyss of poverty. Unfortunately, in reality, these smartly dressed people are living a luxurious life and often spending their time and money abroad. Meanwhile, many of their fellow countrymen live in abject poverty. Donâ€™t they feel embarrassed?

Fast food is a food that serve simply and quickly. It also has delicious taste. Many people think that if they do not eat it, they will feel ‘not cool. Usually, we eat fast food like burger, sandwich, pizza, and so on when we had hangout with our friends. But actually, fast food is bad for daily life for many reasons. The first reason why fast food is bad for daily life is, fast food doesn't contain enough nutrition. Nutrition is a chemical substance that we need for our body, so we can do anything like walking, running, and so on. Malnutrition can cause poor growth and body function. Research on   ​</a>

                                            Cassava
Cassava is the staple food of millions of people in Africa, Asia and South and Central America. Its swollen tuberous root can be boiled and mashed or grated to produce a meal known as ‘farinha’ in Brazil and ‘garri’ in Nigeria, which can be cooked in small cakes. The root is also the source of the manufactured commodity, tapioca. A small field planted with cassava can be insurance against famine, because the crop can be left in the ground for two or three years without deterioration of the tubers. But recent findings suggests that cassava may be responsible for birth defects.
It has other  serious disadvantages. The tubers consist almost entirely of starch and are particularly low in protein so dependence of cassava leads to serious malnutrition. To make matters worse, some varieties, when grown under certain condition are poisonous to people and livestock if eaten raw. These have to be well-prepared for consumption by consumption prolonged and repeated boiling.
The new danger has emerged over the past few years in Nigeria. Doctors have begun to suspect that cassava, if eaten in large amounts during pregnancy, may cause deformities in the developing fetus; there appears to be a correlation between or other neuronal malformations in their babies.

                                            God has created mankind with all its uniqueness. Some usual things we usually do every day turn out to be important. Due to that fact, if the activity is not done, then humans will gett illness, may also be dead. Eating is an everyday activity. As a living creature, food is useful as a nutritional intake and fuel. Humans will experience some health problems for not eating. Malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, until death is the result of a lack of food intake in the body. Drinking, this very easy activity is very important for the body. Humans need water to replace body fluids that come out of perspiration. Lack of fluid can lead to dehydration that can lead to death. Drowsiness is one of the signs that our bodies should be rested. By sleeping, the body will become fresher. When sleeping muscles body is weakened, consequently a stiff body after doing all day activities will also be weakened. When you wake up, your body will be fresher. Lack of sleep is not only resulted in fatigue, but also damage to some organs of the human body.​</a>

                            5. It is a sad state of affairs when we learn from the print and electronic media that many skinny children in many places in Indonesia are lying helplessly with bloated bellies, in severely
malnourished condition. Ironically, we also have learned from the same print and electronic media reports about massive graft involving huge amounts of money, perpetrated by smartly-dressed, smug officials.
It will not be an odd thing if there are some people who question weather or not these smartly-dressed and smug corruptors who hold office in government and legislative agencies have ever learned of these cases of malnutrition, bloated bellies and poverty, which are rampant inthis country. It seems that these people have lost a fraction of their conscience to take pity on their fellow creatures that have been beset by a such misfortune.
These people should have realized that their disgusting corruption has sent many of their fellow countrymen to the abyss of poverty. Unfortunately, in reality, these smartly dressed people are living a luxurious life and often spending their time and money abroad. Meanwhile, many of their fellow countrymen live in abject poverty. Donâ€™t they feel embarrassed?

Fast food is a food that serve simply and quickly. It also has delicious taste. Many people think that if they do not eat it, they will feel ‘not cool. Usually, we eat fast food like burger, sandwich, pizza, and so on when we had hangout with our friends. But actually, fast food is bad for daily life for many reasons. The first reason why fast food is bad for daily life is, fast food doesn't contain enough nutrition. Nutrition is a chemical substance that we need for our body, so we can do anything like walking, running, and so on. Malnutrition can cause poor growth and body function. Research on   ​</h2><br />

                            9. Cassava
Cassava is the staple food of millions of people in Africa, Asia and South and Central America. Its swollen tuberous root can be boiled and mashed or grated to produce a meal known as ‘farinha’ in Brazil and ‘garri’ in Nigeria, which can be cooked in small cakes. The root is also the source of the manufactured commodity, tapioca. A small field planted with cassava can be insurance against famine, because the crop can be left in the ground for two or three years without deterioration of the tubers. But recent findings suggests that cassava may be responsible for birth defects.
It has other  serious disadvantages. The tubers consist almost entirely of starch and are particularly low in protein so dependence of cassava leads to serious malnutrition. To make matters worse, some varieties, when grown under certain condition are poisonous to people and livestock if eaten raw. These have to be well-prepared for consumption by consumption prolonged and repeated boiling.
The new danger has emerged over the past few years in Nigeria. Doctors have begun to suspect that cassava, if eaten in large amounts during pregnancy, may cause deformities in the developing fetus; there appears to be a correlation between or other neuronal malformations in their babies.

Due to that fact, if the activity is not done, then humans will gett illness, may also be dead. Eating is an everyday activity. As a living creature, food is useful as a nutritional intake and fuel. Humans will experience some health problems for not eating. Malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, until death is the result of a lack of food intake in the body. Drinking, this very easy activity is very important for the body. Humans need water to replace body fluids that come out of perspiration. Lack of fluid can lead to dehydration that can lead to death. Drowsiness is one of the signs that our bodies should be rested. By sleeping, the body will become fresher. When sleeping muscles body is weakened, consequently a stiff body after doing all day activities will also be weakened. When you wake up, your body will be fresher. Lack of sleep is not only resulted in fatigue, but also damage to some organs of the human body.​</h2><br />
