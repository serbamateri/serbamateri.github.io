                    <p>One day Mrs. Steele saw a mouse running across her kitchen floor. She was very afraid of mice, so she ran of the house, got in the bus and went to a shop. There she bought a mouse trap. The shopkeeper said to her, &quot;put some cheese in it. And you will soon catch a mouse&quot;.
Mrs. Steele went home with her mouse trap, but when she looked in her cupboard, she could not find any cheese in it. She did not want to go back to the shops, because it was very late. Then she got an idea. She cut a picture of some cheese out of a magazine and put that in the trap.
Surprisingly, the picture of the cheese was quite successful. When Mrs. Steele carne down to the kitchen in the next morning, there was a picture of a mouse in the trap beside the picture of the cheese.

There she bought a mouse trap. The shopkeeper said to her, "put some cheese in it. And you will soon catch a mouse".
Mrs. Steele went home with her mouse trap, but when she looked in her cupboard, she could not find any cheese in it. She did not want to go back to the shops, because it was very late. Then she got an idea. She cut a picture of some cheese out of a magazine and put that in the trap.
Surprisingly, the picture of the cheese was quite successful. When Mrs. Steele carne down to the kitchen in the next morning, there was a picture of a mouse in the trap beside the picture of the cheese.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Animal testing is a deeply divided subject with a great deal of passion, emotion and ideas on both sides regarding the ethic of the practice. Some individuals support animal testing and some other oppose its use.</p><p>The scientific community is strongly in favour in animal testing. The medical breakthroughs that have occured as a result of animal testing are considered reason enough to continue the practice, with the aim of reducing human suffering and saving human lives. Animal testing aids researchers in finding drugs and tratments to improve health and medicine. Many medical treatments have been made possible by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs, insulin, antibiotics, vaccines and many more. Animal testing also helps to ensure the safety of drugs and many other substances human use or are exposed to regularly. Scientists typically use animals for testing purpose because they are considered similar to humans.</p><p>The contra on the issue of animal testing is that countless animals are experimented on and then killed after their use. Others are injured and will still live the rest of their lives in captivity. Many of these animals received tests for substances that will never actually be used for public consumption and use. Animal testing generally costs an enormous amount of money as the animals must be fed, housed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances. The price of the animal themselves must also be factored into equation.</p><p>As a result of the controversy, regulations and laws should be enforced. At the very least, animal suffering should be minimized and that animals shoul be respected during their care. If animal testing is to continue, animals must be abused.</p><p></p><p>1.
